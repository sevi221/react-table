# Tabla realizada con React.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Next steps // TODOs (commented in code)

* Server pagination.
* Loading/spinner for table data.
* Running tests.

## Issues

* Id column: it is hardcoded just to make it a bit nicer.
* User column: it yet so hardcoded, as the api didn't get this info.
